        <item>Being active and getting exercise helps people with Alzheimer’s disease feel better. Exercise helps keep their muscles, joints, and heart in good shape. \nIt also helps people stay at a healthy weight and have regular toilet and sleep habits. </item>
        <item>Regular physical activity is one of the best things that you can do to reduce your risk of developing dementia.</item>
        <item>Drinking too much alcohol increases your risk of developing dementia. \nIf you regularly drink alcohol, try to do so in moderation and within recommended limits. Drinking too much alcohol at one time exposes your brain to high levels of harmful chemicals. \nTry to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol each week. This is equal to about one pint of beer or a small glass of wine each day. If you regularly drink much more than this, you are increasing your risk of damage to your brain and other organs, and so increasing your risk of dementia.</item>
        <item>If you smoke, you’re putting yourself at a much higher risk of developing dementia later in life. \nSmoking does a lot of harm to the circulation of blood around the body, particularly the blood vessels in the brain, as well as the heart and lungs. \nIt’s never too late to quit smoking. The earlier you stop, the more brain damage you will avoid.</item>
        <item>Certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, can increase the risk of getting dementia. An important way to manage this is by going for a health check. \nEating an unhealthy diet may also cause health problems, including obesity, which can be linked to an increased risk of dementia.</item>
